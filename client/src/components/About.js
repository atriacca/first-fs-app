            <p>Clayton Allred has been exploring and pushing the realms of infinite possibilities his whole life. Always learning, growing and expanding. With a very wild imagination and unique creative mind he has always seen things a bit differently, but after attending his first <a href="https://burningman.org/" target='_blank' rel="noopener noreferrer">Burning Man</a> festival in 2001 the realms of possibilities were blown wide open. He saw fire spinning for the first time and a new passion was born. Clayton was in pursuit of his musical career when his attention shifted after being featured on <a href="https://www.homeofpoi.com" target='_blank' rel="noopener noreferrer">Home of Poi</a>’s (Circle of Lights) video in <a href="https://www.homeofpoi.com/us/articles/COL2006.php" target='_blank' rel="noopener noreferrer">2006</a> and <a href="https://www.homeofpoi.com/us/articles/COL2007.php" target='_blank' rel="noopener noreferrer">2007</a> making him a source of inspiration to fire spinners around the world. His love for fire grew and so did his skills.</p>
            <p>Clayton Allred started performing with Adriane Colvin and <a href="http://firemusecircus.com/" target='_blank' rel="noopener noreferrer">Fire Muse Circus</a> in 2007. Fire Muse featured a duet performance by Clayton Allred and Jed McDonald that stunned the fire spinning world in 2008 with huge 30’ tosses off of buildings and cliffs using fire chucks and staffs. This Dynamic Duo created huge ripple effects in the fire world and created many breath taking experiences for people from all over the world with their dynamic, high energy performances. Clayton has been taking it higher and higher. His fire gets bigger and bigger and his heart shines brighter and brighter.</p>
            <p>Clayton unveiled his new staff "LOVE" to the world at the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/lil-hatu-ranch/redirection-festival-2014-awaken-/1418407205069032/" target='_blank' rel="noopener noreferrer">Redirection Festival</a> in May of 2014. The staff "LOVE" birthed a tradition of having the audience initiate two grand wishes for the world each time "LOVE" is lit then sending those wishes to the universe when the audience helps blow out the flame. Many wonderful wishes and memories have been made.</p>
            <p>Clayton continues to captivate his audiences with his unique primal, animalistic movements and his heart to heart connection with the audience can only be felt and cannot be accurately described by words. His fire is HUGE and his message is simple, clear and full of love. Ignite and Unite!</p>
